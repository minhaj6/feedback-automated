# feedback-automated

Guys, the "chromedriver" file I have here works for M1 Mac. If you are rocking linux or windows or whatever, you will have to download your version of "chromedriver" instead of this one. Here's the link https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=101.0.4951.41/

Instructions:
Open the "credentials.py" file
Put your id and pass there.
Update the link to your course feedback page and save.

Run main.py. 

You have to update the course feedback link and run everytime. 
You are welcome to automate that part as well but I am too lazy. 
:D
